**Purpose:** Complete these steps **before** any further content entry or bulk imports.
**Time estimate:** 45–60 minutes
**Environment:** Cloudways Craft CP (or local DDEV)
**After completion:** Run `ddev craft clear-caches/all` (local) and clear caches on Cloudways.

## Craft 5 Notes Before Starting

**Conditional fields** do not use nested groups in Craft 5. Use field conditions in the layout editor:
- Add the lightswitch field (e.g. `hasMilitaryService`)
- Add each dependent field individually to the entry type layout
- In the layout editor, click each dependent field → set condition: "Show when [lightswitch] is enabled"
This applies to: hasMilitaryService, allegedlyHaunted, waterInfrastructure conditionals.

**Matrix field (Roles)** — create a Matrix field named `roles`, one block type named "Role",
sub-fields inside the block type: roleTitle, roleOrganization, roleStart, roleEnd, primaryRole.
Draggable sort order is native to Matrix.

---

## Step 5 – Quick Validation
- [ ] Person entry: confirm hasMilitaryService toggle shows/hides military fields
- [ ] Person entry: confirm roles Matrix field accepts blocks with sub-fields
- [ ] Place entry: confirm allegedlyHaunted toggle shows hauntedNotes
- [ ] Create one test Yearbook entry — confirm all fields present
- [ ] Create one test Photograph entry — confirm donor code help text visible
- [ ] Verify all new taxonomies appear in correct field layouts
- [ ] Run `ddev craft clear-caches/all` locally
- [ ] Clear caches on Cloudways
- [ ] Test that altText is enforced as required on new asset upload

---

## Next Actions After Checklist Complete
1. Military Profile migration script — copy mp* fields to Person, set hasMilitaryService = true, delete Military Profile records
2. Pull Cloudways DB to local DDEV
3. Build organizations/index.twig template
4. Start import pipeline: scan_inventory.py against Leon's HTML archive

## Amendment — 2026-04-15

### culturalSensitivityNote — Add to All Entry Types and Category Layouts

Field created on Cloudways (field ID 174, UID f0a5c7de-ccc3-4005-84ee-53feaafc26e9).
Must be added to field layouts manually in CP.

**Add to entry type layouts:**
- [ ] Person
- [ ] Place
- [ ] Organization
- [ ] Group
- [ ] Event
- [ ] Article
- [ ] Photograph
- [ ] Yearbook
- [ ] Oral History
- [ ] Document

**Add to Category field layout (so individual taxonomy terms carry their own note):**
- [ ] Settings → Categories → each group → Field Layout → drag in culturalSensitivityNote

**Instructions text for the field:**
"Note any CARE Principles or PNAAM considerations. Example: 'Developed in consultation with Fernandeño Tataviam Band of Mission Indians' or 'Chumash content — respect Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians.'"

### JSON-LD Person Template
Created at: templates/_partials/jsonld/person.twig
Include in persons/_entry.twig head block:
{% include '_partials/jsonld/person' with { entry: entry } only %}

### URI Audit Corrections (Do Not Override These)
- water-history: correct URI is https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85145505 (LCSH water supply)
- land-grants: correct URIs are https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1000743 and https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85074242
- Q6683 is the Mexican-American War — do NOT use for land-grants
- Q134166 is reservoir — do NOT use for water-history
- These are already correct in the committed subject-tags.json — do not replace
